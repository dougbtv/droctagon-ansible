## Dr. Octagon - The Ansible Playbooks

Dr Octagon is my openstack/openshift/k8s lab based in [Burlington, VT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burlington,_Vermont) @ [Laboratory B](https://www.facebook.com/LaboratoryB/)

It's a cluster of 8 nodes (hence `oct-` prefix) and it's namesake is the Kool Keith persona, "Dr. Octagon" for all you [earth people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjKHQeRSvjk).

## So, what's it do?

Right now it's a set of Ansible roles and playbooks for getting OpenStack up and reliably running on this setup, in order to bootstrap it in such a way that I can run other container infrastructures on top of it. I'm using this to build example NFV architectures.

I have a lot bigger plans for what I'd like to do with it, so, expect to find a variety of samples of how to re-mix containerized NFV solutions to come here.

## Isolating networks
